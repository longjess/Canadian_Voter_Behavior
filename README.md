# Canadian_Voter_Behavior

Using data from the Canada Election Study (CES) survey for the 2004 and 2021 Canadian federal elections,
I analyzed the influence of class (through union membership and education level) and religion on voter
preference between the Liberal, Conservative, and NDP parties. In particular, I investigated if there was a
shift in the party preference of the different groups under consideration between 2004 and 2021. I used a
weighted multinomial logistic regression model with interaction terms to look at the effects of membership
in each group, and the difference in effect between the years. I found that union members prefer the Liberals
to the Conservatives, and the NDP to the Liberals. There is some preference for the Conservatives over the
Liberals among non-university educated voters. Catholics generally prefer the Liberal party, but there was
a notable increase in support for the Conservatives in 2021. Both mainline and non-mainline Protestants
prefer the Conservative party over the Liberals, with the non-mainline Protestants showing stronger support.

This was my final project for Stanford's STATS305B Applied Statistics II course in Winter 2023.
